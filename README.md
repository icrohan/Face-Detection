Face Detection

Face Detection is an OpenCV-based project that allows you to detect faces in real time using a webcam or image input. This project harnesses the power of computer vision to identify human faces and highlight them dynamically.

Features

👀 Real-time Face Detection: See the magic happen instantly!

🧠 AI-Powered Recognition: OpenCV does the heavy lifting so you don’t have to.

🖼 Multiple Faces: Detects multiple faces at the same time – because one is never enough!

🎭 Bounding Box Overlay: Highlights faces with a stylish rectangle.

🚀 Lightning Fast Processing: Detect faces at the speed of thought!

Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📷 OpenCV

🔢 NumPy

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/icrohan/Face-Detection.git
cd Face-Detection

Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy

Usage

Run the script:

python facedetection.py

Watch as the AI scans for faces like a digital detective. 🕵️‍♂️

Try different angles and see how well it tracks your face!

How It Works

📸 The webcam captures a live video feed.

🤖 The system converts the video into grayscale for faster processing.

🔍 The Haar Cascade or DNN model detects facial features.

🔲 A bounding box is drawn around detected faces in real-time.
